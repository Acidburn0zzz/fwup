# TO DO list

2. Implement on_error handling
3. Validate that all resources in a task are run. If not - error.
5. Non-"verify on the fly" update support
6. Implement require-fwup-version
8. Improve FAT filesystem progress handling. Right now the progress is not
   indicative of what's happening. It could be once the FAT caching code gets
   integrated.
9. Make buffering configurable
